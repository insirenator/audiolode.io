            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Hello, peeps. My name is Shakeeb and here at AudioLode, I'm going to guide you on starting your music journey. I'm also a musician and produce music as a hobby. Here I am assuming that you too want to make music but don't know where to start. So continue reading as I explain it to you.</p>

            <h1>Where to get started?</h1>
            <p>This question confuses most people. They start thinking of buying instruments and other music production gear. But you don't need all that stuff(yet). I will help you to make that starting point easy, and believe me, if you have a laptop or a computer and decent pair of earphones or speakers, you're all set! <br> I make music on my computer using a software called DAW.</p>

            <h1>What's a DAW?</h1>
            <p>A DAW or Digital Audio Workstation is a piece of software the helps you to record music, arrange it, mix it and finally export it in audio format all on your computer. Isn't it amazing? There are many paid DAWs out there in the market but there are also some great free ones. I personally use LMMS(Linux Music Making Software) which is both free as well as open source. And there are many great and useful learning resources for LMMS on youtube and internet. (Some other free DAWs to consider: Bandlab Cakewalk, Waveform Tracktion and Ardour.)</p>

            <h1>Do I just need a DAW?</h1>
            <p>Well, initially a DAW is enough for you to start. Later you can add more stuff to your collection like a MIDI Keyboard, microphone,etc. And you will also need some virtual instrument plugins.</p>

        <div class = "info"> 
            <h1>What's a Virtual Instrument?</h1>
            <p>A virtual instrument plugin is like a software version of some actual instrument like piano, guitar, drums, bass, synth and many more. But the fun thing with these virtual plugins is that you can play them with just a MIDI Keyboard connected to your Computer or you can even play them with your computer keyboard. You would need a DAW to load these plugins and the play them. <br> The upcoming sections are filled with high quality free virtual plugins for you to download and use.</p>

            <h1>Anything else?</h1>
            <p>I hope that now you have a basic idea of where to start. Now you can set up your PC for music production by downloading a DAW and some plugins that I will tell you about in next section. This would work for you even if you're just doing it for hobby or trying to get into music professionally. And one more, do learn an instrument like piano. It will help you a lot. Happy Music Making! </p>
