            <h1>Helm</h1>
            <p>Developed by Matt Tytel, Helm is a great free and open source synthesizer plugin that you can use to synthesize any kind of sound that you want. Having a very clean and beginner-friendly user interface, Helm is the best choice if you are new to sound synthesis and want to learn it. It is available with 'pay what you want' criteria but you can input $0 in the donation box. If you would like to support the creator, do consider donating a few bucks.</p>

            <h1>Vital</h1>
            <p>Boy Oh Boy, what can I say about this one. Vital is too great a synth to sum up in this short section. Created by Matt Tytel (same person who developed Helm), Vital is a super powerful and versatile wavetable synthesizer. This synth is a total beast, featuring various spectral warping modes and an arsenal of shapes, waveforms and wavetables. And the user interface is top-notch. Vital comes with various versions, both paid and free. Free version is same as the paid just with less presets and waveforms. Definitely check this one if you are serious about advanced synthesis. </p>

            <p>TAL-Noisemaker is developed by Togu Audio Line(TAL) and it's an amazing virtual analog synthesizer with a great sound reminiscent of popular hardware synths of 80s and 90s. It comes with a huge bank of great sounding presets ranging from basses, keys and leads; to drum sounds and sound FX. You should definitely check this one out. It's Free!</p>

            <h1>u-He Zebralette</h1>
            <p>This one is a free spectral synthesizer allowing waveform editing with geomorph,    spectromorph, geoblend and spectroblend modes. Developed by U-He, Zebrallete is a free version of their much powerful and paid synth, Zebra2. Zebrallete is obviously less featureful than Zebra2 but still it's quite powerful. I personally use this synth to create weirdly unique and interesting sounds. It's a must have.</p>

            <h1>u-He TyrellN6</h1>
            <p>Also created by U-He, the manufacturer describes it as a compact and sporty synth. Modeled after the design of hardware synthesizers, it's a very good software manifestation of hardware synth ideas. Coming with a huge bank of quality and great sounding presets, it's also a must have. <br>(Personally, I think that the name of this synth was taken from Tyrell Corporation's Nexus 6 Replicants from Blade Runner.)</p>
